# PlaysTVClipRecovery

## Introduction
On December 15th, 2019, plays.tv discontinued their website and desktop application as seen in this [post](https://twitter.com/OfficialPlaysTV/status/1197270790707634176).

If you did not download your videos by this time they were gone. Recently we came across this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Archiveteam/comments/ef5i9n/finding_lost_videos_on_playstv_archive/) which explains that archive.org attempted to save some of the videos. The instructions for manually saving your videos can be found below.

Unfortunately, manually saving clips is very tedious especially for someone with many clips. The goal of this project is to try and automate that process.

## Deployment

## Manually Save Clips
1. Open your user profile page in the Wayback Machine, e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20191210043532/https://plays.tv/u/g0dspirit.

2. Copy the link for one of the videos. In the above example, the first video is https://web.archive.org/web/20191210043532/https://plays.tv/video/5d4b309b459e4014aa/samwell-sick-1vs5-clutch-esportal-clutch-5vs1-insaneplay-clipoftheweek?from=user&_t=eyJ0eXBlIjoiZnJvbSIsImxvY2F0aW9uIjoiUmVwbGF5VXNlckNvbnRyb2xsZXIuVXNlclZpZGVvc01vZC12aWRlb3MiLCJmZWVkX2lkIjoiNWQ0YjMwOWI0NTllNDAxNGFhIiwiZ2FtZV9pZCI6IjA0MDk0YmYxZjE2MjU5NGIyODcwN2I1MGM0ZTgzNDllIiwibGlua19pZCI6InZpZGVvX2xpc3RfdGl0bGUifQ%3D%3D.

3. Remove all parameters from the URL, resulting in https://web.archive.org/web/20191210043532/https://plays.tv/video/5d4b309b459e4014aa/samwell-sick-1vs5-clutch-esportal-clutch-5vs1-insaneplay-clipoftheweek.

4. Open that.

5. On the resolution selector (right of the time in the player), select 720p.

6. Play.

If either the user page or the video page is not in the Wayback Machine, they might not have been saved.
