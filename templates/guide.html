    <p>
        On December 15th, 2019, Plays.TV discontinued their website and desktop application as seen in this <a target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OfficialPlaysTV/status/1197270790707634176">post</a>.
        If you did not download your videos by this time they were gone. 
        Recently we came across this <a target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Archiveteam/comments/ef5i9n/finding_lost_videos_on_playstv_archive/">here</a> which explains that archive.org succeeded in saving some (not all) of the videos. 
        The thread also provides instructions for manually saving your videos.
        Unfortunately, manually saving clips is very tedious especially for someone with many clips.
        For this reason we automated this process as explained below.
    </p>
    <p>
        We scrape the provided Plays TV profile page on archive.org.
        After scraping the PlaysTV profile page, links to all of the clips are obtained. Next we go to each of those
        pages and check if the mp4 video exists. If it does, the clip has been saved by archive.org, we download it for you. 
        We collect all of these videos, and zip them up for you.
